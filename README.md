### Local Setup
1. Create a directory on your local machine (or run the following command where you want the repo to be cloned)
2. Run `git clone git@github.com:jiyeongchloe/ReadEase.git`
3. Done!

### Dev / Commit Guidelines
To keep everything organized, let's use branches for adding new features instead of committing everything to `main` immediately.

**Creating a Branch**
- Option 1: On the main page of the repository, click on the dropdown branch menu near the top left corner. Enter a name for the new branch in the textbox and click `create ___ branch from dev`
- Option 2: In the terminal, `cd` to the root of the repository and run `git branch <name of new branch>`

**Checking Current Branch**
Run `git branch --show-current` in terminal

**Switching Branches**
Run `git switch <name of branch you want to switch to>`

### Testing / Running the Extension
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Toggle `Developer mode` near the top right corner of the page
3. Click on `Load unpacked` near the top left corner of the page
4. Select the directory that you have cloned the repo to
5. The extension should now be added
